こんにちわ (for those non-hiragana readers that means "hello")!

If you couldn't figure out from my domain, my name is Kaia Lane (pronounced Ki-Uh and ryhmes with papaya if that helps). 

I love themse and topics involving death (very edgy), Japanese history and culutre, murder, serial killers, and anything dark. I love reading, writing, Japanese food, hella good Mac n' Cheese, drawing, and binge-watching 12 seasons of Criminal Minds in a month. My Spotify playlist consists of Japanese rock, French rap, Punk, Classic Rock, K-pop, Korean rock, Alternative, and Korean rap. I don't get to reading actual novels often because of my short attention span, but some of my favorites are Sherman Alexie, Sandra Cisneros, Rainbow Rowell, Cassandra Clare, George Orwell, Chuck Palahniuk, and S.E. Hinton. Even though I do have favorite novelists, my true reading love is Manga (yes that is what I said), and Anime but that has nothing to with reading...well it does because I have to read the subtitles but that's not important. 

I'm a recipient of "__The Messiest Room on the West Coast__" award and I guess you could say I'm proud of it. 

My goals in life are to piss as many people off as I can, have a book on a banned book list, see how many people I can get to think I'm a sociopath, graduate high school with decent grades, become fluent in Japanese, make a short film shown at some festival, and have a published book.
